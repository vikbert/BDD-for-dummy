# BDD For Dummy from the DDD perspective

This tutorial will guide you to using BDD to start a simplistic "already known" 
`Authentication` domain, then introduce you to have a short look at DDD 
with tactical DDD concepts in the target `domain`.

### How to start

First, [install composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/).

After that, you can run:

```sh
$ composer install
$ yarn install  ## npm install

# Open a new terminal, then
$ php -S 127.0.0.1:8010 -t public


# Open another terminal, then
$ bin/behat
```
